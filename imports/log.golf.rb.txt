Sparql Results= {:abs=>"Green Lakes State Park is a New York State Park that is visited nearly a million times each year, located just east of Syracuse in upstate New York. Not only is the park strikingly scenic, but it has a \"masterpiece\" golf course designed by Robert Trent Jones very early in his career, and Green Lake itself is perhaps the most studied meromictic lake &ndash; one in which layers of water do not mix &ndash; in the world. Round Lake has been designated as a National Natural Landmark by the U.S. Department of the Interior. Finally, the park preserves the largest stand of old growth forest in Central New York. Green Lakes State Park was named as one of the Top 100 Campgrounds in the nation in 2004. The park is centered on two small lakes, Green Lake and Round Lake, which have an unusual blue-green color. The lakes lie at the base of a gorge that is somewhat longer than a mile in length.

It remains one of the few men-only golf clubs in the United States. The course originated in May 1897 as the Island Golf Links, a nine hole layout for guests of the Garden City Hotel. Designed by Devereux Emmet, it was soon expanded to eighteen holes with a total length of over 6,000 yards (5,500 m), making it the longest course in the United States. The expanded course was incorporated as the Garden City Golf Club on May 17, 1899. Its club house was designed by Richard Howland Hunt. Garden City Golf Club hosted the U.S. Open in 1902, which was won by Laurie Auchterlonie. It marked the first time that a player had shot lower than 80 in all four rounds. Amateur Walter Travis, a founding member of the Garden City Golf Club, finished second in the tournament. A few years later, Travis redesigned the layout of his home course, adding numerous bunkers and modifying the greens. Ironically, Travis hit a ball into a new pot bunker near the eighteenth green during the 1908 U.S. Amateur at the Garden City Golf Club, which led to his defeat in a semifinal match against Jerry Travers.

Max and Louis Kutsher started the Kutshers Brothers Farm House in 1907 and began expanding in the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1940s, at the request of his aunt Rebecca, Milton Kutsher took over the hotel. He oversaw their expansion into the facility we know today - a \"1,500 acre property that now includes the 400-room resort, condos, two bungalow colonies, the sports camp, golf course and lakefront. \" Milton Kutsher and his wife Helen ran the hotel until his death in 1998. His son Mark currently runs the hotel along with Helen. Milton Kutsher was very active in sports circles, \"making the hotel the Catskills home of legendary Celtics coach Red Auerbach and Hall of Famer Wilt Chamberlain, who once served as a bellhop there. There was the Maurice Stokes Benefit, a charity basketball game that once attracted the top pro players. Muhammad Ali even trained at Kutsher\342\200\231s, as did another world heavyweight champion, Leon Spinks and as did Floyd Patterson in the 1950s. \" He saw sports as a way to bring young people to the resort.

Sparql Results= {:abs=>"Shadow Creek is an 18-hole golf course in North Las Vegas, Nevada, designed by Tom Fazio and built by Las Vegas casino magnate Steve Wynn in 1989. Built from empty desert flatland on a 350-acre (1.4 km) site, it cost a reported sixty million dollars. During construction, over three million cubic yards of dirt was dug up from the desert floor and pushed around the perimeter, creating a berm that blocked any view from the outside. An estimated 21,000 trees of more than 200 varieties were then planted around the sides of the course and in and around each individual hole, providing a sense of seclusion and intimacy. It opened in 1989 as one of the most exclusive golf courses in the world. Only invited casino guests of Steve Wynn or the Mirage properties could play the course, and tee times were one hour apart, so only a handful of groups played the course every day. Today the course is open to all MGM Mirage property guests, and the green fee is $500, including round trip limousine rental from the Strip and club rental. The course rarely sees more than two dozen rounds in a day, many from PGA professionals, Las vegas local dignataries and VIPs, celebrites, professional athletes, spokespeople, and the occasional CEO. Some of the names on the lockers in the clubhouse are George Bush, Michael Jordan, John Elway, and Wilt Chamberlain The course features lakes, waterfalls, rolling hillsides, more than 200 varieties of trees, flowing rock bed streams, rocky outcroppings, and exotic birds. Through its design, it was intended be an experience; one that worked in movements that would begin subtly and crescendo to a peak every several holes, and then repeat. No hole was to be visible from another. All four par 3's are uniques and extraordinary; the one is hit over a valley full of trees, another is in a bowl shaped valley entered and exited through a tunnel. The course is also the location of private residences. One, near the 18th hole, was Steve Wynn's home until 2005, when he sold it to MGM Mirage for $17 million. The four-bedroom house includes a two-story library, theater, wine cellar, and two pools, one with an underwater speaker system. The second house was owned by Wynn Las Vegas COO Mark Schorr until 2004. The Course went through a 17 million dollar renovation last summer (May 2008-December 2008) through care of Tom Fazio and is now open. The course received all new Tees, Fairways, rough, bunkers and greens. A number of holes were redesigned and lengthened with bunkers added. The course now sets up at 7,560 yards compared to 7,239 on its original design. During renovation they also added a 7 acre short game facility with 4 target greens and bunkers and a generous putting green. Course record: Original Design: Tiger Woods &amp; Fred Couples (60) Current Course record: Post renovation: 70 Famous holes: 17: par 3, plays from 150 to 130. The hole features an island green with a waterfall in the back. 16: a behemoth par 5 that measures 622 yards (569 m). The hole doglegs right and features an elevated tee box. 15: a par 4 of 483 yards in which players hit back into the mountains. A creek runs down the left side of the hole and across the green.

The course is also the location of private residences. One, near the 18th hole, was Steve Wynn's home until 2005, when he sold it to MGM Mirage for $17 million. The four-bedroom house includes a two-story library, theater, wine cellar, and two pools, one with an underwater speaker system. The second house was owned by Wynn Las Vegas COO Mark Schorr until 2004. The Course went through a 17 million dollar renovation last summer (May 2008-December 2008) through care of Tom Fazio and is now open. The course received all new Tees, Fairways, rough, bunkers and greens. A number of holes were redesigned and lengthened with bunkers added. The course now sets up at 7,560 yards compared to 7,239 on its original design. During renovation they also added a 7 acre short game facility with 4 target greens and bunkers and a generous putting green. Course record: Original Design: Tiger Woods &amp; Fred Couples (60) Current Course record: Post renovation: 70 Famous holes: 17: par 3, plays from 150 to 130. The hole features an island green with a waterfall in the back. 16: a behemoth par 5 that measures 622 yards (569 m). The hole doglegs right and features an elevated tee box. 15: a par 4 of 483 yards in which players hit back into the mountains. A creek runs down the left side of the hole and across the green. Shadow Creek is generally ranked among the top 25 courses in the world by many major golf publications.", "longitude"=>-115.105959, "source_id"=>"Shadow_Creek_Golf_Course", "source"=>"DBP", "use_code"=>"golf"}

The property is \"rich with historical significance,\" according to the city of Rancho Mirage, which declared Sunnylands a historic site in 1990. Located at Frank Sinatra and Bob Hope Drives, the property has been the vacation site of numerous celebrities and public officials. Construction on the Sunnylands estate began in 1963. Renowned interior designer William Haines and assistant Ted Graber were in charge of the project, which included University of Southern California professor A. Quincy Jones. It was designed using Spanish-desert styles. At one time, the house was the largest in Riverside County. The property includes the main house, guest quarters, servant quarters, a private 18-hole golf course, and 12 man-made lakes. Inside the main house is a significant art collection acquired by the Annenbergs. It is largely hidden from public view; a pink-brick wall surrounds the estate, next to hundreds of eucalyptus and olive trees and thick belts of oleander. Sunnylands has been the vacation site of a wide range of celebrities. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his wife, Mamie, joined the Annenbergs to golf and fish. President Richard Nixon wrote his 1974 State of the Union Address at the house and, after leaving office, was a guest at Sunnylands when President Gerald Ford pardoned him for any wrongdoing in the Watergate scandal. Ford and his wife Betty were frequent guests as well. President Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan were close friends of the Annenbergs and visited every New Year's. President George H. W. Bush hosted a state dinner at the house for Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu in 1990. Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have stayed at the house as well. Following the Islamic Revolution in Iran in the late 1970s, the family of the Shah of Iran was invited to seek refuge at Sunnylands. Queen Elizabeth II visited for lunch, and Prince Charles made occasional weekend visits. The property required such privacy for world leaders that it earned restricted air space status. Other notable people who have stayed on the property include Frank Sinatra (who was married there), Bob Hope, Fred Astaire, Gregory Peck, Ginger Rogers, Bing Crosby, Mary Martin, and Sammy Davis, Jr. An education facility is currently being built on the property, and will be known as the Annenberg Education Center at Sunnylands. After Ambassador Walter Annenberg's death in 2002 and Mrs. Annenberg's death in March 2009, ownership was transferred into a family trust and limited, guided public tours of the sprawling facilities will be offered.

The property was owned by Walter and Leonore Annenberg until 2009 and was used as a winter retreat by the couple since 1963. The property is \"rich with historical significance,\" according to the city of Rancho Mirage, which declared Sunnylands a historic site in 1990. Located at Frank Sinatra and Bob Hope Drives, the property has been the vacation site of numerous celebrities and public officials. Construction on the Sunnylands estate began in 1963. Renowned interior designer William Haines and assistant Ted Graber were in charge of the project, which included University of Southern California professor A. Quincy Jones. It was designed using Spanish-desert styles. At one time, the house was the largest in Riverside County. The property includes the main house, guest quarters, servant quarters, a private 18-hole golf course, and 12 man-made lakes. Inside the main house is a significant art collection acquired by the Annenbergs. It is largely hidden from public view; a pink-brick wall surrounds the estate, next to hundreds of eucalyptus and olive trees and thick belts of oleander. Sunnylands has been the vacation site of a wide range of celebrities. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his wife, Mamie, joined the Annenbergs to golf and fish. President Richard Nixon wrote his 1974 State of the Union Address at the house and, after leaving office, was a guest at Sunnylands when President Gerald Ford pardoned him for any wrongdoing in the Watergate scandal. Ford and his wife Betty were frequent guests as well. President Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan were close friends of the Annenbergs and visited every New Year's. President George H. W. Bush hosted a state dinner at the house for Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu in 1990. Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have stayed at the house as well. Following the Islamic Revolution in Iran in the late 1970s, the family of the Shah of Iran was invited to seek refuge at Sunnylands. Queen Elizabeth II visited for lunch, and Prince Charles made occasional weekend visits. The property required such privacy for world leaders that it earned restricted air space status. Other notable people who have stayed on the property include Frank Sinatra (who was married there), Bob Hope, Fred Astaire, Gregory Peck, Ginger Rogers, Bing Crosby, Mary Martin, and Sammy Davis, Jr. An education facility is currently being built on the property, and will be known as the Annenberg Education Center at Sunnylands. After Ambassador Walter Annenberg's death in 2002 and Mrs. Annenberg's death in March 2009, ownership was transferred into a family trust and limited, guided public tours of the sprawling facilities will be offered. Both Ambassador and Mrs. Annenberg are interred on the property.", "longitude"=>-116.410717, "source_id"=>"Sunnylands", "source"=>"DBP", "use_code"=>"golf"}

The logo of Torrey Pines Golf Course features a salt pruned Torrey Pine. Much like Bethpage Black on Long Island, Torrey Pines has a unique method to ensure continued public access to the course. On weekends, individuals arrive as early as 6 p.m. the prior night to get in line for the first come / first serve tee times that are given out from sunrise till the first reservations at 7:30 a.m. Torrey Pines is the home of the PGA Tour Farmers Insurance Open each year in January or February. It hosts the San Diego City Amateur Golf Championships every June, and the Junior World Golf Championships every July and hosted the 2008 U.S. Open Golf Championship. Torrey Pines is a featured golf course in the 1990 computer game Links: The Challenge of Golf by Access Software (now Indie Built) and Microsoft Golf 2.0 by Microsoft, as well as Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003 by EA Sports. It is named after the Torrey Pine, a rare tree that grows in the wild only along this local stretch of the coastline in San Diego County and on Santa Rosa Island. Tiger Woods won the 2008 U.S. Open Golf Championship over Rocco Mediate in a sudden death playoff on the seventh hole of the South Course with a par over Rocco Mediate's bogey after playing an eighteen hole playoff, which they finished with even par 71's. Tiger Woods had to birdie the 72nd hole in order to force the playoff and again in the playoff on the 90th hole in order to reach sudden death; further, both players finished the tournament at 283, which was one under par. This was Tiger Woods third U.S. Open victory, and his fourteenth major win for his career, which put him four behind Jack Nicklaus in men's major golf championships.", "longitude"=>-117.245353460312, "source_id"=>"Torrey_Pines_Golf_Course", "source"=>"DBP", "use_code"=>"golf"}
