Sparql Results= {:abs=>"Brighton Ski Resort is a ski area located in Big Cottonwood Canyon, 30 miles from downtown Salt Lake City, Utah. Brighton Ski Resort was the first ski resort in Utah, and one of the first in the United States. Brighton was started in 1936 when members of the Alpine Ski Club built a rope tow from wire and an old elevator motor. Brighton claims to be a \"no-frills\" resort whose sole business is to provide skiers and snowboarders with top-notch trails. While it does provide lodging, dining, and shopping, the extent of the facilities does not make Brighton what is typically seen as a destination ski resort. Most Brighton skiers and riders are Utah locals. Most visitors do not stay at Brighton-run lodging; many visitors stay in the greater Salt Lake area, many of whom also plan trips to other area ski resorts. Brighton is on public land; all of the resort's land is actually part of the Wasatch-Cache National Forest, meaning the whole resort is open to the public year-round, though tickets must be purchased to use the lifts. Brighton is a local favorite. They offer a variety of special deals throughout the year that allow locals to ski for cheap. Generally, the first Wednesdays in December they have Quad Wednesdays where you bring something to contribute to a local charity and get your lift ticket for 1/4th the price. Brighton has some of the most extensive night skiing in the West \342\200\223 with over 200 acres, three lifts, and the main mountain terrain park. Night skiing is from 4 \342\200\223 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday from early December through early April.

It is a vast snow resort stretching from Niseko Annupuri\342\200\231s summit (elevation 1,308.5 m) to its base, and it is famous for its fine-quality powder snow. Because of this, Hirafu is frequented by many non-Japanese skiers and snowboarders. For a long time, two companies operated the mountain, but in June 2004 it was arranged that the three ski resorts of the Niseko Hirafu area would be administered by the Tokyu Resort Service; Tokyu Real Estate Company, the parent company of the Tokyu Resort Service, wished to consolidate ownership to one organization. In August 2004, it was announced that an Australian company called Japan Harmony Resort purchased the Hanazono ski area from Tokyu Real Estate.

Brighton was started in 1936 when members of the Alpine Ski Club built a rope tow from wire and an old elevator motor. Brighton claims to be a \"no-frills\" resort whose sole business is to provide skiers and snowboarders with top-notch trails. While it does provide lodging, dining, and shopping, the extent of the facilities does not make Brighton what is typically seen as a destination ski resort. Most Brighton skiers and riders are Utah locals. Most visitors do not stay at Brighton-run lodging; many visitors stay in the greater Salt Lake area, many of whom also plan trips to other area ski resorts. Brighton is on public land; all of the resort's land is actually part of the Wasatch-Cache National Forest, meaning the whole resort is open to the public year-round, though tickets must be purchased to use the lifts. Brighton is a local favorite. They offer a variety of special deals throughout the year that allow locals to ski for cheap. Generally, the first Wednesdays in December they have Quad Wednesdays where you bring something to contribute to a local charity and get your lift ticket for 1/4th the price.

It is a vast snow resort stretching from Niseko Annupuri\342\200\231s summit (elevation 1,308.5 m) to its base, and it is famous for its fine-quality powder snow. Because of this, Hirafu is frequented by many non-Japanese skiers and snowboarders. For a long time, two companies operated the mountain, but in June 2004 it was arranged that the three ski resorts of the Niseko Hirafu area would be administered by the Tokyu Resort Service; Tokyu Real Estate Company, the parent company of the Tokyu Resort Service, wished to consolidate ownership to one organization. In August 2004, it was announced that an Australian company called Japan Harmony Resort purchased the Hanazono ski area from Tokyu Real Estate. However, so far the two have jointly administered such services as lift tickets. Because of this relationship and the subsequent development of the whole resort, the mountain attracts a large number Australian tourists every winter. Niseko Higashiyama Ski Ground and Niseko Annupuri International Ski Ground are connected with Grand Hirafu at the top of the mountain, and it is possible to access all three of the slopes by using a special lift ticket called the Niseko Free Passport.", "longitude"=>140.698059, "source"=>"DBP"}

In the summer, Marquette Mountain offers activities such as mountain biking, and volleyball. The base area's parking lot is adjacent to highway M-553. Popular from the start, the ski area opened in 1957. It was originally known as Cliffs Ridge, as it operated on land leased from the Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company of Cleveland, Ohio. The first chairlift, a Riblet double, was installed on the skier's right side of Rocket Run in the fall of 1972. Prior to that there were 2 T-bars (the original Constam on the skier's left of Rocket and a newer Hall Ski-Lift on the skier's left of Snowfield) and several rope tows. The ski area was renamed \"Marquette Mountain\" in 1982. Marquette Mountain is host to alpine race events for numerous clubs, as well as their own race program. They also host NASTAR races. The hill has a summit elevation of 1357 ft (414 m) above sea level and a vertical drop of 600 ft (183 m). It has three chairlifts and a rope tow, snowmaking, night skiing, and receives an average of 210 inches (533 cm) of snowfall annually, the grateful recipient of lake effect snow from nearby Lake Superior, prominently visible to the north and northeast.

Sparql Results= {:area=>4500000.0, :home=>"http://www.fallscreek.com.au", :abs=>"Falls Creek is a ski-in, ski-out ski resort in north-eastern Victoria, Australia. It is located about 350 kilometres by road from Melbourne in the Alpine National Park, with the nearest town Mount Beauty, approximately 30 kilometres away. The resort lies between an altitude of 1,210 and 1,830 metres, with the highest lifted point at 1780 metres. The snow there is said to be the best in Australia. Skiing is possible on the nearby peak of Mount McKay at 1,842 metres, traveling by snowcat from the resort. Until 2005, when the Government of Victoria did not renew grazing licenses, the high plains in the area were used for cattle grazing in the summer since 1851. Mount Bogong, Victoria's highest mountain, is nearby. Some of the cattlemen's huts still survive and are a tourist attraction in summer. After World War II the Kiewa Hydroelectric Scheme was started in the Kiewa River valley by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria. On land previously used only for summer cattle grazing in the natural alpine grasslands, the first ski lodge was built in 1948 by workers from the scheme. The first lift, a rope tow, was built in 1951 and the first chairlift in Australia was constructed there in 1957. Falls Creek Post Office opened on 9 June 1958 (with telegraph and telephone facilities only until 1964). Falls Creek, with its higher altitude, is regarded as having better runs for proficient skiers than Mount Buffalo or Mount Buller and ranks with Mount Hotham as Victoria's best. It is also especially beginner/intermediate friendly, with almost 80% of the resort dedicated to these types of skiers/snowboarders. It has wide open vistas and rolling hills unique to the High Plains in Victoria, creating uncrowded skiing conditions and very short queues of just two or three minutes at most even on very busy weekends (cf. Mount Buller wait times of 20-30 minutes or more during peak times). However, Australia's notoriously fickle snow conditions ensure that snowmaking using the water from the nearby Rocky Valley Dam is sometimes, particularly early in the season, the main source of skiable snow. Consequently, like all Australian snowfields, Falls Creek's customer base is almost entirely domestic, however many international cross country skiers travel to Falls Creek for the Kangaroo Hoppet, Australia's Worldloppet event on the last Saturday of August. The resort features 4,500 accommodation beds, and consequently a large number of restaurants, bars, and nightclubs to amuse the guests at night. Some apartments are privately owned, but the resort's management requires that they must be available for hire when not occupied. The resort also serves as a summer base to explore the massive national park surrounding the resort.

The main lodge is at the base of the ski runs and, being located in a river valley, at the end of a steep road. The tops of the lifts are at the top of the river valley, in relatively flat prairie farmland. While unloading at the top of the triple chairlift, you see a working oil pump jack and often cattle grazing immediately in front of you. Canyon Ski Area was one of the first Canadian ski resorts to get artificial snowmaking equipment in the 1960s. As a result of this and relatively cold fall temperatures in central Alberta, it was reliably one of the first ski areas to open in Canada. Consequently, the Canadian national ski team used Canyon Ski Area for its early season training in the 1960s.", "longitude"=>-113.685472222222, "source"=>"DBP"}

Sparql Results= {:area=>4855877.0688, :home=>"http://www.durangomountainresort.com/", :abs=>"Durango Mountain Resort, also known by its former name Purgatory (known to the locals) is a ski resort located in the San Juan Mountains of Southwest Colorado, 15 miles north of the town of Durango. It was originally opened in 1965 and offers 85 trails, including 2 terrain parks, the Paradise Freestyle Arena and Pitchfork Terrain Garden. And also the Divine expression sessions. It has 11 ski lifts, including one six-person \"Flying Couch\" or \"Six pack\" and one high speed quad lift. Average annual snowfall is 260 inches per year, and artificial snow is produced on approximately one-fifth of the mountain. The elevation at the summit is 10,822 feet, with a vertical drop of 2,029 feet. The name Purgatory comes from a 1776 Spanish Expedition led by Silvestre V\303\251lez de Escalante. Several Spanish explorers traveling on a nearby river were lost. Their bodies were never found and the other explorers believed that the souls of the lost men would be relegated to Purgatory. The Purgatory Ski Area got its name from the miners of the 1890s. The base of the ski area is an area once called Purgatory Flats.

Sugarloaf recorded a total of 352,000 skier visits in the 2005-2006 season, ranking it second among Maine resorts and 11th in New England, according to Ski Area Management magazine. At 4,237 feet (1291 m) Sugarloaf Mountain is second in elevation to Maine's highest peak, Katahdin. The summit of Sugarloaf offers the only lift-serviced above-treeline skiing in the Northeast. The Appalachian Trail crosses within 0.6 miles of Sugarloaf's peak and the summit offers 360 degree views of Maine's western mountains and New Hampshire's White Mountains. As of March 2010, there were 54 miles (87 km) of marked trails and a total of 651 acres (2.6 km) of developed trails. There were 1,400 acres (6 km) of skiable area boundary to boundary. The fifteen chairlifts have the capacity to carry 21,180 skiers per hour. There are also 138 marked trails and glades, most of which are named after logging terms in a tribute to Maine's logging history. Trails include thirty-four rated as green circle (25%), forty-four blue square (32%), thirty-nine black diamond (28%), and twenty-one rated double black diamond (15%). There are also twenty glades (13%), and three terrain parks. Lifts include two SuperQuads, two high-capacity quads, eight doubles, one triple, and one T-bar surface lift. The Sugarloaf season runs from mid-November through late April.", "longitude"=>-70.3130555555556, "source_id"=>"Sugarloaf_%28ski_resort%29", "source"=>"DBP"}

The ski resort features long and steep runs, open bowls, chutes, and tree runs; and claims to be \"The largest and steepest resort in Southern California,\" with 26 runs spanning 3 mountains featuring a peak elevation of 8,600 feet (2,600 m). Baldy spans 800 acres (3.2 km) with an impressive 2,100 feet (640 m) vertical drop, and is located just 45 miles (72 km) from Los Angeles, making it the closest resort to the city.

It provides locals with affordable great terrain and outstanding snowfall, without the tourist crowds found at Big Sky and Moonlight Basin, destination ski resorts an hour south of Bozeman. The ski area and mountain range are named after noted mountain man Jim Bridger, and is accessed from state highway 86. In addition to the existing base lodge and a mid-mountain lodge, a new main lodge opened in 2005 at the base area.

Sparql Results= {:abs=>"Brighton Ski Resort is a ski area located in Big Cottonwood Canyon, 30 miles from downtown Salt Lake City, Utah. Brighton Ski Resort was the first ski resort in Utah, and one of the first in the United States. Brighton was started in 1936 when members of the Alpine Ski Club built a rope tow from wire and an old elevator motor. Brighton claims to be a \"no-frills\" resort whose sole business is to provide skiers and snowboarders with top-notch trails. While it does provide lodging, dining, and shopping, the extent of the facilities does not make Brighton what is typically seen as a destination ski resort. Most Brighton skiers and riders are Utah locals. Most visitors do not stay at Brighton-run lodging; many visitors stay in the greater Salt Lake area, many of whom also plan trips to other area ski resorts. Brighton is on public land; all of the resort's land is actually part of the Wasatch-Cache National Forest, meaning the whole resort is open to the public year-round, though tickets must be purchased to use the lifts. Brighton is a local favorite. They offer a variety of special deals throughout the year that allow locals to ski for cheap. Generally, the first Wednesdays in December they have Quad Wednesdays where you bring something to contribute to a local charity and get your lift ticket for 1/4th the price. Brighton has some of the most extensive night skiing in the West \342\200\223 with over 200 acres, three lifts, and the main mountain terrain park.

Eldora is the second closest ski area to the Denver metro area. By a large margin, it is the closest to Boulder, and is one of the few Colorado ski resorts on the east side of the continental divide. It is about 20 miles west of Boulder and about 45 miles from downtown Denver. The ski and ride bus, operated by RTD, departs Boulder for the ski area five times daily in the winter and serves as easy transportation from town to mountain. The ski area was founded in 1962 and has proven popular partly due to skiers not having to use the extremely busy I-70 to reach the resort. The summit of the area is at 10,800 feet (3,300 m) above sea level on Bryan Mountain, with a 1600-foot (488 m) vertical drop. The slopes face primarily east and north, and the main base area is at 9,400 feet (2,900 m). The resort caters primarily to day skiers, although some overnight accommodations are available in Nederland, and many hotel rooms are available in Boulder. In addition to alpine skiing, the ski area also includes 40 km of cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. Eldora Mountain Resort is one of Colorado's smaller ski areas and has a family atmosphere.

Because of this, Hirafu is frequented by many non-Japanese skiers and snowboarders.

In August 2004, it was announced that an Australian company called Japan Harmony Resort purchased the Hanazono ski area from Tokyu Real Estate. However, so far the two have jointly administered such services as lift tickets. Because of this relationship and the subsequent development of the whole resort, the mountain attracts a large number Australian tourists every winter.

It is a vast snow resort stretching from Niseko Annupuri\342\200\231s summit (elevation 1,308.5 m) to its base, and it is famous for its fine-quality powder snow. Because of this, Hirafu is frequented by many non-Japanese skiers and snowboarders. For a long time, two companies operated the mountain, but in June 2004 it was arranged that the three ski resorts of the Niseko Hirafu area would be administered by the Tokyu Resort Service; Tokyu Real Estate Company, the parent company of the Tokyu Resort Service, wished to consolidate ownership to one organization. In August 2004, it was announced that an Australian company called Japan Harmony Resort purchased the Hanazono ski area from Tokyu Real Estate. However, so far the two have jointly administered such services as lift tickets. Because of this relationship and the subsequent development of the whole resort, the mountain attracts a large number Australian tourists every winter. Niseko Higashiyama Ski Ground and Niseko Annupuri International Ski Ground are connected with Grand Hirafu at the top of the mountain, and it is possible to access all three of the slopes by using a special lift ticket called the Niseko Free Passport.", "longitude"=>140.698059, "source_id"=>"Niseko_Mt._Resort_Grand_Hirafu", "source"=>"DBP"}

Describing itself as the \"first dedicated freestyle terrain park in the world\" when it opened in 2002, it features a number of half-pipes, jumps and rails, instead of traditional ski runs. On-mountain accommodation has been available since 2006, prior to which people needed to commute daily from Wanaka or Queenstown. The site shares an access road with nearby Snow Farm. A recent gondola proposal has been submitted, which would allow Snow Park to install a gondola running from the valley floor (near the Cardrona Valley Road) to the current base of the park. Stated reasons for this include dust and visibility, carbon dioxide emissions, and environmental impact. In summer, the same site operates as a freestyle mountain biking park, under the name Dirt Park. It also includes 2 downhill runs.

Sparql Results= {:abs=>"Falls Creek is a ski-in, ski-out ski resort in north-eastern Victoria, Australia. It is located about 350 kilometres by road from Melbourne in the Alpine National Park, with the nearest town Mount Beauty, approximately 30 kilometres away. The resort lies between an altitude of 1,210 and 1,830 metres, with the highest lifted point at 1780 metres. The snow there is said to be the best in Australia. Skiing is possible on the nearby peak of Mount McKay at 1,842 metres, traveling by snowcat from the resort. Until 2005, when the Government of Victoria did not renew grazing licenses, the high plains in the area were used for cattle grazing in the summer since 1851. Mount Bogong, Victoria's highest mountain, is nearby. Some of the cattlemen's huts still survive and are a tourist attraction in summer. After World War II the Kiewa Hydroelectric Scheme was started in the Kiewa River valley by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria. On land previously used only for summer cattle grazing in the natural alpine grasslands, the first ski lodge was built in 1948 by workers from the scheme. The first lift, a rope tow, was built in 1951 and the first chairlift in Australia was constructed there in 1957. Falls Creek Post Office opened on 9 June 1958 (with telegraph and telephone facilities only until 1964). Falls Creek, with its higher altitude, is regarded as having better runs for proficient skiers than Mount Buffalo or Mount Buller and ranks with Mount Hotham as Victoria's best. It is also especially beginner/intermediate friendly, with almost 80% of the resort dedicated to these types of skiers/snowboarders. It has wide open vistas and rolling hills unique to the High Plains in Victoria, creating uncrowded skiing conditions and very short queues of just two or three minutes at most even on very busy weekends (cf. Mount Buller wait times of 20-30 minutes or more during peak times). However, Australia's notoriously fickle snow conditions ensure that snowmaking using the water from the nearby Rocky Valley Dam is sometimes, particularly early in the season, the main source of skiable snow. Consequently, like all Australian snowfields, Falls Creek's customer base is almost entirely domestic, however many international cross country skiers travel to Falls Creek for the Kangaroo Hoppet, Australia's Worldloppet event on the last Saturday of August. The resort features 4,500 accommodation beds, and consequently a large number of restaurants, bars, and nightclubs to amuse the guests at night. Some apartments are privately owned, but the resort's management requires that they must be available for hire when not occupied. The resort also serves as a summer base to explore the massive national park surrounding the resort.

Despite the resort name, there is in fact no Cypress Mountain in the immediate vicinity (there is a Cypress Mountain in the Vancouver area, located 24 km east, in Coquitlam just southwest of the south end of Coquitlam Lake.", "longitude"=>-123.203333333333, "source_id"=>"Cypress_Mountain_Ski_Area", "source"=>"DBP"}

This land is part of the Blue Hills Reservation, a state park managed by the DCR. Blue Hills has eight trails covering a vertical drop of 309 feet (94 m). The summit is served by a double chairlift, while the beginner area has a magic carpet and a large magic carpet. There is a lodge with food service, restrooms, ski patrol and a small equipment shop. A separate building serves as a rental outlet with locker storage. The hill is popular with high school ski teams, and often hosts races on Big Blue. While the land and many of the improvements are owned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the management of the area has historically been leased out to a variety of operators. The 2006\342\200\2232007 season is the 6th year of a 6-year \"lease\" to the people (Mr. Al Endriunas) who own and operate Ragged Mountain Resort in New Hampshire. In 2007, the management of Campgaw Mountain, located in Northern, New Jersey started a 5-year lease. While the lift line (\"Beer's Bluff\" named for two brothers, Bob and Stuart Beers, who managed the ski area from the late '60s through the mid '80s) is listed on the trail map, it is currently not maintained for skiing. There has been talk that the trail would be cut for the 2008-2009 season, but the trail remains untouched. This reduces the total skiable trails to 7. In the early 1960s the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC, now the DCR) operated the ski area. There were only two lifts, both rope tows, one on the main slope and one on the \"bunny\" slope. During that time the lift ticket cost $0.50 a day. In approximately 1965 the area was leased to an outside company called Larchmont Engineering who constructed a chair lift and installed snow-making on the main slope and the bunny slope. Larchmont was an early innovator in the snow-making business and experimented with various hose and gun/nozzle designs. In February, 1969 the area was hit with three 2+ ft snow storms, each a week apart. The snow was so deep that skiing down the \"face\" of Big Blue (the side facing Route 128) was possible.

A separate building serves as a rental outlet with locker storage. The hill is popular with high school ski teams, and often hosts races on Big Blue. While the land and many of the improvements are owned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the management of the area has historically been leased out to a variety of operators. The 2006\342\200\2232007 season is the 6th year of a 6-year \"lease\" to the people (Mr. Al Endriunas) who own and operate Ragged Mountain Resort in New Hampshire. In 2007, the management of Campgaw Mountain, located in Northern, New Jersey started a 5-year lease. While the lift line (\"Beer's Bluff\" named for two brothers, Bob and Stuart Beers, who managed the ski area from the late '60s through the mid '80s) is listed on the trail map, it is currently not maintained for skiing. There has been talk that the trail would be cut for the 2008-2009 season, but the trail remains untouched. This reduces the total skiable trails to 7. In the early 1960s the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC, now the DCR) operated the ski area. There were only two lifts, both rope tows, one on the main slope and one on the \"bunny\" slope. During that time the lift ticket cost $0.50 a day. In approximately 1965 the area was leased to an outside company called Larchmont Engineering who constructed a chair lift and installed snow-making on the main slope and the bunny slope. Larchmont was an early innovator in the snow-making business and experimented with various hose and gun/nozzle designs. In February, 1969 the area was hit with three 2+ ft snow storms, each a week apart. The snow was so deep that skiing down the \"face\" of Big Blue (the side facing Route 128) was possible.

Sparql Results= {:abs=>"Whistler Blackcomb is a major ski resort located 125 km north of Vancouver, in British Columbia, Canada. By many measures it is the largest ski resort in North America; it is 50% larger than its nearest competitor in terms of size, has the greatest uphill lift capacity, and until 2009, had the highest vertical skiable distance by a wide margin. Whistler Blackcomb also features the Peak 2 Peak Gondola for moving between Whistler and Blackcomb mountains at the top; Peak 2 Peak holds records for the highest and longest unsupported cable car span in the world. With all of this capacity, Whistler Blackcomb is also often the most-visited ski resort, often besting 2 million visitors a year. Whistler was originally conceived as part of a bid to win the 1968 Winter Olympics, but a series of events led to the bids being withdrawn or losing to other cities. Construction of the resort started in spite of this, and first opened for business in February 1966. The resort built out extensively in the 1980s and 90s, and became the centrepiece of a renewed bid on the part of nearby Vancouver. Vancouver/Whistler was selected as the winning bid for the 2010 Winter Olympics in July 2003. Whistler Blackcomb hosts the alpine skiing events, including the men's and women's Olympic and Paralympic alpine skiing disciplines of downhill, Super-G, giant slalom, super combined and slalom. The Dave Murray downhill course towards Whistler Creekside will finally host an Olympic downhill event, 50 years after it was originally surveyed for this purpose. Whistler and Blackcomb were originally separate resorts, until they merged in 1997. Intrawest, a BC real estate firm, purchased Whistler and merged the two operations. Over the next decade, the company expanded by purchasing additional ski resorts across North America, before expanding into golf and other resorts as well. Today, Intrawest owns ten ski resorts, another ten getaway resorts (mostly beachside) and two heliskiing companies. Whistler Village, widely recognized for its livable design, formed the basis of similar Tyrolian-inspired developments at their expanding series of resorts, as well as other resorts that hired Intrawest to build similar developments on their behalf. In 2006 Intrawest was purchased by the alternative asset management firm, Fortress Investment Group. Three weeks before the opening of the 2010 Olympics, Fortress failed to make payment on its loan used to buyout Intrawest. This caused its creditors to force Intrawest to divest itself of several of its resort holdings in 2009 and 2010 which includes Whistler Blackcomb, in order to reduce its debt load.", :max=>2182.0, :area=>13814970.260736, :home=>"http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/", :name=>"Whistler Blackcomb", :loc=>"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Whistler_Mountain", :point=>"50.108333333333334 -122.9425", "source_id"=>"Whistler_Blackcomb", :min=>653.0}

The Summit lift was purchased from the Spokane world fair, while the Silver King was purchased from Whistler, where it had previously been the Olive chair.

Then at the beginner\342\200\231s hill, there is a small double chairlift. Next to it is a magic carpet lift. Then at the learning center is another magic carpet. Then last is a snowtubing magic carpet. In March of 2010, Shawnee announced that it had purchased a new High Speed-Detachable chairlift from Doppelmayr CTEC. This quad is planned to go into service for the 2010-2011 ski season. This lift, called the Tomahawk Express, will be put where the current fixed grip quad stands. The fixed grip quad will be moved to the location of the current Arrowhead Triple chairlift. The triple will be retired. The mountain also features 100% snow making, night skiing and snow tubing. The mountain summit receives an average of 50 inches (1,300 mm) of snow fall each winter. The resort opened in 1975.", "longitude"=>-75.0833333333333, "source_id"=>"Shawnee_Mountain_Ski_Area", "source"=>"DBP", "state"=>"PA"}

Sparql Results= {:abs=>"Turoa is a large skifield on the south western side of Mount Ruapehu, the highest mountain in the North Island of New Zealand. There is a good mix of beginner, intermediate, and expert skiing routes. There is a mix of natural pipes, steep drops, fast plains, and easy slopes to suit the needs of all skiers and boarders. With over 400 hectacres (1000 acres) and 720 metres (2362 feet) vertical, Turoa offers plenty of variety. The skifield is reached via the Mountain Road from the town of Ohakune. The Mountain Road was built by locals from Ohakune, mostly during weekends after they formed the Mountain Road Association in 1952. Their aim was to open Ruapehu's southern slopes for skiing, partly as a replacement industry for the decline in logging which had sustained the town for the previous decades. The now renamed Ministry of Works helped with the road on one occasion by 'misplacing' a culvert destined for another roading project. The 17 kilometres-long road was opened in 1963.

The Mountain Road was built by locals from Ohakune, mostly during weekends after they formed the Mountain Road Association in 1952. Their aim was to open Ruapehu's southern slopes for skiing, partly as a replacement industry for the decline in logging which had sustained the town for the previous decades. The now renamed Ministry of Works helped with the road on one occasion by 'misplacing' a culvert destined for another roading project. The 17 kilometres-long road was opened in 1963.

Most Brighton skiers and riders are Utah locals. Most visitors do not stay at Brighton-run lodging; many visitors stay in the greater Salt Lake area, many of whom also plan trips to other area ski resorts. Brighton is on public land; all of the resort's land is actually part of the Wasatch-Cache National Forest, meaning the whole resort is open to the public year-round, though tickets must be purchased to use the lifts. Brighton is a local favorite. They offer a variety of special deals throughout the year that allow locals to ski for cheap. Generally, the first Wednesdays in December they have Quad Wednesdays where you bring something to contribute to a local charity and get your lift ticket for 1/4th the price. Brighton has some of the most extensive night skiing in the West \342\200\223 with over 200 acres, three lifts, and the main mountain terrain park. Night skiing is from 4 \342\200\223 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday from early December through early April.

Sparql Results= {:abs=>"Turoa is a large skifield on the south western side of Mount Ruapehu, the highest mountain in the North Island of New Zealand. There is a good mix of beginner, intermediate, and expert skiing routes. There is a mix of natural pipes, steep drops, fast plains, and easy slopes to suit the needs of all skiers and boarders. With over 400 hectacres (1000 acres) and 720 metres (2362 feet) vertical, Turoa offers plenty of variety. The skifield is reached via the Mountain Road from the town of Ohakune. The Mountain Road was built by locals from Ohakune, mostly during weekends after they formed the Mountain Road Association in 1952. Their aim was to open Ruapehu's southern slopes for skiing, partly as a replacement industry for the decline in logging which had sustained the town for the previous decades.

It is located about 350 kilometres by road from Melbourne in the Alpine National Park, with the nearest town Mount Beauty, approximately 30 kilometres away. The resort lies between an altitude of 1,210 and 1,830 metres, with the highest lifted point at 1780 metres. The snow there is said to be the best in Australia. Skiing is possible on the nearby peak of Mount McKay at 1,842 metres, traveling by snowcat from the resort. Until 2005, when the Government of Victoria did not renew grazing licenses, the high plains in the area were used for cattle grazing in the summer since 1851. Mount Bogong, Victoria's highest mountain, is nearby. Some of the cattlemen's huts still survive and are a tourist attraction in summer. After World War II the Kiewa Hydroelectric Scheme was started in the Kiewa River valley by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria. On land previously used only for summer cattle grazing in the natural alpine grasslands, the first ski lodge was built in 1948 by workers from the scheme. The first lift, a rope tow, was built in 1951 and the first chairlift in Australia was constructed there in 1957. Falls Creek Post Office opened on 9 June 1958 (with telegraph and telephone facilities only until 1964). Falls Creek, with its higher altitude, is regarded as having better runs for proficient skiers than Mount Buffalo or Mount Buller and ranks with Mount Hotham as Victoria's best. It is also especially beginner/intermediate friendly, with almost 80% of the resort dedicated to these types of skiers/snowboarders. It has wide open vistas and rolling hills unique to the High Plains in Victoria, creating uncrowded skiing conditions and very short queues of just two or three minutes at most even on very busy weekends (cf. Mount Buller wait times of 20-30 minutes or more during peak times). However, Australia's notoriously fickle snow conditions ensure that snowmaking using the water from the nearby Rocky Valley Dam is sometimes, particularly early in the season, the main source of skiable snow. Consequently, like all Australian snowfields, Falls Creek's customer base is almost entirely domestic, however many international cross country skiers travel to Falls Creek for the Kangaroo Hoppet, Australia's Worldloppet event on the last Saturday of August. The resort features 4,500 accommodation beds, and consequently a large number of restaurants, bars, and nightclubs to amuse the guests at night. Some apartments are privately owned, but the resort's management requires that they must be available for hire when not occupied. The resort also serves as a summer base to explore the massive national park surrounding the resort.

Sparql Results= {:loc=>"http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Plata_County%2C_Colorado", :abs=>"Durango Mountain Resort, also known by its former name Purgatory (known to the locals) is a ski resort located in the San Juan Mountains of Southwest Colorado, 15 miles north of the town of Durango. It was originally opened in 1965 and offers 85 trails, including 2 terrain parks, the Paradise Freestyle Arena and Pitchfork Terrain Garden. And also the Divine expression sessions. It has 11 ski lifts, including one six-person \"Flying Couch\" or \"Six pack\" and one high speed quad lift. Average annual snowfall is 260 inches per year, and artificial snow is produced on approximately one-fifth of the mountain. The elevation at the summit is 10,822 feet, with a vertical drop of 2,029 feet. The name Purgatory comes from a 1776 Spanish Expedition led by Silvestre V\303\251lez de Escalante. Several Spanish explorers traveling on a nearby river were lost. Their bodies were never found and the other explorers believed that the souls of the lost men would be relegated to Purgatory. The Purgatory Ski Area got its name from the miners of the 1890s. The base of the ski area is an area once called Purgatory Flats.

Sparql Results= {:loc=>"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grand_County%2C_Colorado", :abs=>"Winter Park Resort is an alpine ski resort in Winter Park, Colorado in the Rocky Mountains. Located just off U.S. Highway 40, the resort is about an hour and a half's drive from Denver, Colorado. The mountain opened for the 1939\342\200\2231940 season as Winter Park Ski Area and was owned and operated by the city and county of Denver until 2002, when Denver entered into a partnership with Intrawest ULC, a Canadian corporation headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, which has operated the resort since then. For nearly 70 years a popular way for Denver residents \342\200\224 many of whom have learned to ski or snowboard at Winter Park over the years \342\200\224 to get there was via the Ski Train, which arrived at the resort's base area though the Moffatt Tunnel. (The Ski Train was terminated by the railroad in spring 2009). It is home to one of the world's largest and oldest disabled skiing programs, the National Sports Center for the Disabled. The resort consists of three interconnected mountain peaks \342\200\224 Winter Park, Mary Jane, and Vasquez Ridge \342\200\224 which share a common lift ticket. Mary Jane, opened in 1975, has a separate base area and is known for its moguls, tree skiing, hidden huts and generally more difficult terrain. It encompasses the above-tree line terrain of Parsenn Bowl. Vasquez Ridge, opened in 1986, offers intermediate terrain and mogul runs.

Whistler Blackcomb also features the Peak 2 Peak Gondola for moving between Whistler and Blackcomb mountains at the top; Peak 2 Peak holds records for the highest and longest unsupported cable car span in the world. With all of this capacity, Whistler Blackcomb is also often the most-visited ski resort, often besting 2 million visitors a year. Whistler was originally conceived as part of a bid to win the 1968 Winter Olympics, but a series of events led to the bids being withdrawn or losing to other cities. Construction of the resort started in spite of this, and first opened for business in February 1966. The resort built out extensively in the 1980s and 90s, and became the centrepiece of a renewed bid on the part of nearby Vancouver.

The other, located in an area between the highest Pedr\303\263 dels Quatre Batlles and Estivella, has no road access: to get there is need to take a 2-seater chairlift from SSW orientation of the tracks beneath which often suffer from lack of snow . This makes this sector (which has no artificial snow cannon) is often closed when the rest of the season is open, although the higher tracks (and therefore with more snow).", "longitude"=>1.56194444444444, "source_id"=>"Port_del_Comte", "source"=>"DBP"}

Sparql Results= {:abs=>"Crabtree Falls is located in the George Washington National Forest in Nelson County, Virginia and is the tallest waterfall in the United States east of the Mississippi River. The name of the waterfall is thought to have come from William Crabtree, who settled in this part of Virginia in 1777. The waterfall is often credited with being 1,200 feet (370 m) high (356 m), but is likely closer to 1,000 feet (305 m). Crabtree Falls is a cascading waterfall, with five major cascades, the tallest of which is about 400 feet (122 m), and several smaller cascades. The cascade with a 400-foot (120 m) drop also gives Crabtree Falls the title of tallest vertical drop in a waterfall east of the Mississippi River. However, the title of tallest free-fall vertical drop goes to Fall Creek Falls in Tennessee's Fall Creek Falls State Park. There is a trail to the waterfall maintained by the United States Forest Service called the Crabtree Falls Trail. A sign near the beginning of the trail claims that 25 people have fallen to their death from climbing too close to the waterfalls and warns visitors to stay on the trail.

The waterfall is often credited with being 1,200 feet (370 m) high (356 m), but is likely closer to 1,000 feet (305 m). Crabtree Falls is a cascading waterfall, with five major cascades, the tallest of which is about 400 feet (122 m), and several smaller cascades. The cascade with a 400-foot (120 m) drop also gives Crabtree Falls the title of tallest vertical drop in a waterfall east of the Mississippi River. However, the title of tallest free-fall vertical drop goes to Fall Creek Falls in Tennessee's Fall Creek Falls State Park. There is a trail to the waterfall maintained by the United States Forest Service called the Crabtree Falls Trail. A sign near the beginning of the trail claims that 25 people have fallen to their death from climbing too close to the waterfalls and warns visitors to stay on the trail.

It is located about 350 kilometres by road from Melbourne in the Alpine National Park, with the nearest town Mount Beauty, approximately 30 kilometres away. The resort lies between an altitude of 1,210 and 1,830 metres, with the highest lifted point at 1780 metres. The snow there is said to be the best in Australia. Skiing is possible on the nearby peak of Mount McKay at 1,842 metres, traveling by snowcat from the resort. Until 2005, when the Government of Victoria did not renew grazing licenses, the high plains in the area were used for cattle grazing in the summer since 1851. Mount Bogong, Victoria's highest mountain, is nearby. Some of the cattlemen's huts still survive and are a tourist attraction in summer. After World War II the Kiewa Hydroelectric Scheme was started in the Kiewa River valley by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria. On land previously used only for summer cattle grazing in the natural alpine grasslands, the first ski lodge was built in 1948 by workers from the scheme. The first lift, a rope tow, was built in 1951 and the first chairlift in Australia was constructed there in 1957. Falls Creek Post Office opened on 9 June 1958 (with telegraph and telephone facilities only until 1964). Falls Creek, with its higher altitude, is regarded as having better runs for proficient skiers than Mount Buffalo or Mount Buller and ranks with Mount Hotham as Victoria's best. It is also especially beginner/intermediate friendly, with almost 80% of the resort dedicated to these types of skiers/snowboarders. It has wide open vistas and rolling hills unique to the High Plains in Victoria, creating uncrowded skiing conditions and very short queues of just two or three minutes at most even on very busy weekends (cf. Mount Buller wait times of 20-30 minutes or more during peak times). However, Australia's notoriously fickle snow conditions ensure that snowmaking using the water from the nearby Rocky Valley Dam is sometimes, particularly early in the season, the main source of skiable snow. Consequently, like all Australian snowfields, Falls Creek's customer base is almost entirely domestic, however many international cross country skiers travel to Falls Creek for the Kangaroo Hoppet, Australia's Worldloppet event on the last Saturday of August. The resort features 4,500 accommodation beds, and consequently a large number of restaurants, bars, and nightclubs to amuse the guests at night. Some apartments are privately owned, but the resort's management requires that they must be available for hire when not occupied.

The historic Mullan Pass, constructed as a wagon road by the U.S. Army in 1860, is about 3 miles (5 km) east-northeast as the crow flies, at 5168 feet (1575 m). Lookout Pass is considered the eastern boundary of Idaho's Silver Valley mining region. Opened in 1935, the Lookout Pass ski area operates under a special-use permit of the U.S. Forest Service, in the Idaho Panhandle National Forests (formerly the Coeur d'Alene National Forest). A new portion of the ski area opened on December 26, 2003 on the Montana side of the border (which is irregular in this area, following mountains, and is actually due south, see topo map). The new Timber Wolf double chair and five new runs increased the vertical drop (by lowering the base to 4500 ft), and the longest new run 1.2 miles (2 km) in length. Two of the new runs are rated advanced and three are rated intermediate, with views of the St. Regis and Copper Basins. Additional expansion in 2006 with a chairlift on the Idaho \"North Side\" opened additional intermediate and expert terrain. Lookout Pass has two freestyle terrain parks, and a quarter pipe that is 1111 ft. (339 m) in length.", "longitude"=>-115.708333333333, "source_id"=>"Lookout_Pass_Ski_and_Recreation_Area", "source"=>"DBP", "state"=>"MT"}

Sparql Results= {:abs=>"Blue Hills Ski Area is located on the western face of Great Blue Hill in Canton, Massachusetts. This land is part of the Blue Hills Reservation, a state park managed by the DCR. Blue Hills has eight trails covering a vertical drop of 309 feet (94 m). The summit is served by a double chairlift, while the beginner area has a magic carpet and a large magic carpet. There is a lodge with food service, restrooms, ski patrol and a small equipment shop. A separate building serves as a rental outlet with locker storage. The hill is popular with high school ski teams, and often hosts races on Big Blue. While the land and many of the improvements are owned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the management of the area has historically been leased out to a variety of operators. The 2006\342\200\2232007 season is the 6th year of a 6-year \"lease\" to the people (Mr. Al Endriunas) who own and operate Ragged Mountain Resort in New Hampshire. In 2007, the management of Campgaw Mountain, located in Northern, New Jersey started a 5-year lease. While the lift line (\"Beer's Bluff\" named for two brothers, Bob and Stuart Beers, who managed the ski area from the late '60s through the mid '80s) is listed on the trail map, it is currently not maintained for skiing. There has been talk that the trail would be cut for the 2008-2009 season, but the trail remains untouched. This reduces the total skiable trails to 7. In the early 1960s the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC, now the DCR) operated the ski area. There were only two lifts, both rope tows, one on the main slope and one on the \"bunny\" slope. During that time the lift ticket cost $0.50 a day.

The 2006\342\200\2232007 season is the 6th year of a 6-year \"lease\" to the people (Mr. Al Endriunas) who own and operate Ragged Mountain Resort in New Hampshire. In 2007, the management of Campgaw Mountain, located in Northern, New Jersey started a 5-year lease. While the lift line (\"Beer's Bluff\" named for two brothers, Bob and Stuart Beers, who managed the ski area from the late '60s through the mid '80s) is listed on the trail map, it is currently not maintained for skiing. There has been talk that the trail would be cut for the 2008-2009 season, but the trail remains untouched. This reduces the total skiable trails to 7. In the early 1960s the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC, now the DCR) operated the ski area. There were only two lifts, both rope tows, one on the main slope and one on the \"bunny\" slope. During that time the lift ticket cost $0.50 a day.

While it does provide lodging, dining, and shopping, the extent of the facilities does not make Brighton what is typically seen as a destination ski resort.

Brighton is a local favorite. They offer a variety of special deals throughout the year that allow locals to ski for cheap.

In addition to the existing base lodge and a mid-mountain lodge, a new main lodge opened in 2005 at the base area. Bridger Bowl opened the new Schlasman's chairlift for the 2008-09 season, the first lift-served terrain expansion in 30 years. Schlasman's is a reconditioned 1976 Doppelmayr double chair, formerly known as the \"Peruvian\" lift, purchased from Snowbird ski resort in Utah. This new lift (named after a miner who died in an avalanche in 1885) rises 1700 vertical feet (518 m) and adds 311 acres (1.26 km) of new lift-served terrain for expert skiers only. To ride this lift, skiers are required to carry an avalanche transceiver; partners and shovels are highly recommended.", "longitude"=>-110.896666666667, "source_id"=>"Bridger_Bowl_Ski_Area", "source"=>"DBP"}

At the base of Ski Idlewild was which was Idlewild Guest Ranch, a hotel built three years before the ski area opened. The Idlewild Lodge hotel, not to be confused with the Ski Idlewild base lodge, was a part of the Idlewild Guest Ranch and featured tennis courts, a swimming pool, a disc golf course, cross country ski trails, and the Idlewild Barn, an ice skating rink. After many years of providing novice skiers with fun and affordable skiing, Ski Idlewild closed on March 20, 1986. In 1986, the left sheave train (wheel system) of the chairlift failed and fell to the ground. There were no deaths or injuries, but four people had to be evacuated from the lift by the ski patrol. Ski Idlewild could not pay the $550 inspection fee to the Colorado Passenger Tramway Safety Board, and the ski area was abandoned. The Idlewild Guest Ranch continued its operation as a cross-country ski area, and the Ski Idlewild base lodge was closed and used for document storage. Idlewild Lodge teamed up with Devil's Thumb Ranch in Tabernash, creating a vast network of cross country ski trails connecting Tabernash, Fraser, and Winter Park. In 1994, the Idlewild Lodge hotel was sold, renovated, and reopened for winter and summer operation until closing again in summer 1996. Up until the close of the hotel in 2002, the ski area was serviced by the Winter Park Resort shuttle, which provided free transportation to Ski Idlewild.", "longitude"=>-105.779166666667, "source_id"=>"Ski_Idlewild", "source"=>"DBP"}

The climate at Powderhorn's high desert location -- southeast of Salt Lake City and slightly north and east of Colorado National Monument -- produces dry, powder snow. The Rocky Mountain News said,\"Powderhorn makes up for a lack of vertical with two quality terrain parks,\" and noted Powderhorn's \"Old West feel\" and focus on \"families, beginner and intermediate skiers. \" Powderhorn has a wide variety of terrain with a few long groomed runs as well as steeper tree runs and boulder fields full of jumps and cliffs.", "longitude"=>-108.155555555556, "source_id"=>"Powderhorn_Resort", "source"=>"DBP", "state"=>"CO"}

Pebble Creek's runs are on the northwestern slope of Bonneville Peak (a.k. a Mount Bonneville), whose summit is 9271 feet (2825 m) above sea level, the highest elevation in the Portneuf Range. The lift-served summit is 8560 feet (2609 m), with a vertical drop of 2200 feet (670 m). Accessing the summit of Bonneville Peak by foot is allowed, gaining 711 vertical feet (216 m), giving a total vertical drop of 2911 feet (887 m). The ski area opened in 1949 as Skyline, with two rope tows and a warming hut. A Poma lift was installed in 1958, and another in 1960. The first chairlift (double) was installed in 1966 which opened steeper terrain, and the current day lodge was built in 1968. The area was sold in 1978 and again a year later to the Pebble Creek Land Company, which changed the area's name to Pebble Creek in 1979.
